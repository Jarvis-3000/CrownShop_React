for styling we were using SCSS
But as the application grows the styling names may conflict

1.) One solution
    we can use CSS in JS like,
    <div style={{'name':'value'}}></div>

    But this does not support some of the styles like hover and many more 
    And also the code looks very confusing, big


2.) Second solution
    we can use BEM(Block Element Modifier), it's a styling method.
    But in this we have to use big big names like, 
        => .container .header .title 
        => .container .main .collection .item .name

    So it becomes very less effective and daunting

3.) Third Solution    
    So we can use one library 
        => "styled-components" (CSS-JS library)
        =>we can leverage this library in many ways

# Info
  It is a full-featured eCommerce website, that has features like a cart for adding products in, a top product carousel, stripe integrated payment gateway is also there.

  Used React-Redux to build this.

  The problem that I faced while building this project is that when I started this project, I had very little idea about state management stuff, but when I reached that level    where it was being difficult for me to handle state and it was becoming a headache for me to debug code project which has many states, so then I came to know about Redux which   is a state management tool and mostly used with react. 

  Redux’s core idea is that the whole state of the app is contained in one central location. Every element of an application can access the application status directly without sending props to child components or by calling back data to parents. So after learning redux, I embedded it in my project which helped me in managing state in a proper manner and with that debugging became easy for me but with that my code became somewhat complex.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
